## About

This project was built for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard). It's a webpage aiming to look like an admin dashboard, built using predominantly CSS Grid. I tried to personalize the page, incorporating my name and own personal projects. The webpage has no functionality, however new project cards will be added as I complete more personal projects.
